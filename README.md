# BUS-306-Text-Analysis-for-Business
BUS-306 introduced text analysis: converting raw text into data for business insights. I learned Python, NLP, and web scraping. In the Earnings Report Project, we predicted market reactions to financial reports. In the Kickstarter Project, we analyzed campaign text, predicting funding success. I also learned sentiment analysis and the ethics of AI.
