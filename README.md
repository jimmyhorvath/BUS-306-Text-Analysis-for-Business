# BUS-306-Text-Analysis-for-Business
This class introduced me to text analysis, allowing for the conversion of raw text into data that may be explored. The goal of text analysis is to generate insights that guide business related decisions. Additionally, I learned natural language processing, the basics of Python programming, and developed an understanding of how language and text are interpreted. 

Throughout the course, I completed two projects that analyzed real-world textual data. First, in a three-person group, I completed an Earnings Report Project. During the project, we developed a tool that analyzes financial earnings reports to generate a prediction of the market reaction to each report. Those predictions were tested against actual market reactions. We started with $100,000 and ended with just over $103,000. We tokenized the MD&A (Management Discussion & Analysis) section of multiple 10-Ks into words and sentences for analysis. 

The second group project was titled the Kickstarter Project. We developed a tool that analyzes the text from Kickstarter campaigns to generate a prediction of the likelihood that the campaign would be successful in receiving the required funding. Those predictions were then tested against whether the campaign was successful or not. 

Throughout the course, we had four goals. First, we learned introductory Python programming. Secondly, we learned natural language processing and applications of text analysis and sentiment analysis, especially for business applications. Thirdly, we learned web scraping to collect textual data and generate usable information from web sources. Lastly, we discussed ethical concerns related to text analysis, especially with how rapid advances in AI technology are affecting text analytics.
